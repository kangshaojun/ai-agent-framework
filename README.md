# AI Agent FrameWork

An enterprise-grade AI Agent framework built with modern technologies. This project demonstrates a complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system with a three-tier architecture: Next.js frontend for interactive chat UI, FastAPI backend for business logic, and LangChain-powered AI layer for intelligent responses. Features include real-time streaming conversations via SSE, local deployment with Ollama and Weaviate for data privacy, JWT authentication, and Docker containerization. Designed for data-sensitive industries including banking, healthcare, insurance, and education that require secure on-premise deployment to keep sensitive data private.
